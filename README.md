# Irizz Theme
YEAH, THIS README WAS WRITTEN BY AI DON"T SHAME ME. Every fact here is correct tho.

Irizz Theme is a visually stunning and user-friendly mod for the rhythm game "soundsphere" (soundsphere.xyz). Its main purpose is to enhance the game's user interface and overall aesthetic appeal, making it more attractive and accessible to new players.

## Features

- Completely redesigned user interface for various game screens, including Song Select, Collections, Settings, and Result screen.
- New UI elements such as buttons, checkboxes, and more, redesigned for improved usability and visual appeal.
- Stylish and eye-catching visuals that provide a modern and polished look without being overwhelming.
- Localization support and custom sounds for an immersive experience.

## Planned Improvements

- Redesigned Multiplayer screen to match the visual style of other game screens.
- New Music Player screen

## Customization

Currently, basic customization is supported through the following methods:

- Replace `userdata/avatar.{imageFormat}` with your desired avatar image.
- Replace `userdata/game_icon.{imageFormat}` with your custom game icon.
- Add audio files to `moddedgame/irizz/sounds/start/` to customize the start sound.
- Add background images to `'userdata/backgrounds/`. If the chart does not have it's own background image, random image from this directory will be loaded instead.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release ZIP archive from the "Releases" tab.
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP archive.
3. Copy the "Module patcher" and "Irizz-theme" mods into the `moddedgame` directory within the game's root folder. If the `moddedgame` directory does not exist, create it.

## Compatibility and Updates

- It is recommended to turn off automatic updates for the base game if the Irizz Theme is working correctly to avoid potential compatibility issues.
- Update the base game only when a new version of the Irizz Theme is available, as frequent updates can break compatibility.
